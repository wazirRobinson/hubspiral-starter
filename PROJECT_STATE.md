What “spin up websites” should look like (so you can deliver fast)
You’ll want a Client Website Starter Kit

A repeatable template you clone per client, with:

Config-only content (siteConfig.js)

4 core pages:

Home

Services

Portfolio/Gallery (optional)

Contact/Quote

SEO defaults (titles/meta)

Form intake

Optional Stripe deposit flow

You already have ~70% of this kit built.

The correct next step after portfolio

After we finish the portfolio, the next step is not building a new client site immediately.

Next step is:
“Productize” your current app into a reusable template

Meaning:

Create a /templates or “client-starters” approach

Standardize siteConfig keys

Add a siteConfig.example.js

Add a “Client Onboarding Checklist”

Add a one-command deploy flow (later)

This is what lets you spin up a new site in hours, not days.

The fastest “spin-up” workflow (what you’ll do per client)

Clone repo

Update siteConfig.js (business name, services, service areas, phone/email)

Swap logo + brand colors

Add 5–10 project photos (if available)

Deploy

Hook up domain + email routing

That’s the whole business.

One important caveat

If you mean “spin up websites” as in mass-produce many sites quickly, you’ll want:

A “starter” + “growth” template variant

A list of prebuilt service modules (reviews, gallery, service area map, FAQ)

A content intake form

We can build that right after portfolio.

Answer (straight)

✅ Yes — after the portfolio is finished and the quote flow is stable, you’re ready to start launching client sites.

If you want, once we finalize the portfolio, I’ll help you turn this into a Client Website Factory:

clone → config → deploy

repeatable delivery in 1–2 sessions per client
These are just notes I'd like to remember.
